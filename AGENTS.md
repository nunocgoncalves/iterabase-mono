# Iterabase monorepo operating instructions

## Bound context before exploring

- Start with this file, identify the owning directory below, then read that directory's `AGENTS.md` before inspecting implementation files.
- Do not search or read the whole repository by default. Keep exploration inside the owning directory unless the ticket names a cross-component contract or evidence proves another owner must change.
- For a cross-component change, inspect only the named contract surfaces and record why each additional directory is in scope.
- Deployment overlays and the marketing site are separate repositories. Do not look for or add customer-specific overlay behavior here.

## Ownership map

| Directory | Owns | Scoped instructions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `control-plane/` | Product API, operator/CRDs, dashboard, durable work runtime, harness, and tool runner | [`control-plane/AGENTS.md`](control-plane/AGENTS.md) |
| `inference-gateway/` | OpenAI-compatible inference routing, snapshot consumption, auth enforcement, and rate limiting | [`inference-gateway/AGENTS.md`](inference-gateway/AGENTS.md) |
| `forge/` | Host/k3s bootstrap, substrate reconciliation, and Forge-owned E2E | [`forge/AGENTS.md`](forge/AGENTS.md) |
| `charts/` | Helm packaging and declarative install/upgrade/rollback behavior | [`charts/AGENTS.md`](charts/AGENTS.md) |
| `testkit/` | Shared deterministic E2E mechanics and compiled scenario catalogue | [`testkit/AGENTS.md`](testkit/AGENTS.md) |
| `docs/` | Monorepo-wide durable repository documentation | This file |

The Go modules remain independently buildable. The root `go.work` is for atomic local development; do not merge component modules or introduce cross-module imports without an approved architectural decision.

## Source and release authority

- This monorepo is the sole writable public source for the product components above. The former `control-plane`, `inference-gateway`, `forge`, and `iterabase-charts` repositories are historical archives; never target them for changes, pull requests, CI, or releases.
- Official artifacts publish to `ghcr.io/iterabase/*`, with charts under the `ghcr.io/iterabase/iterabase-charts` OCI namespace. These are stable artifact identities, not source repository links. Do not rename them during source maintenance. Artifacts published earlier under `ghcr.io/nunocgoncalves/*` remain published and are never deleted or republished.
- A merge to `master` is integration, not a semantic release. Ticket acceptance must state whether publication is required (required, deferred, or none). When it is, publish only through the manual, founder-approved `release.yml` workflow described in [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md); never publish implicitly from merge or acceptance.
- Deployment overlays continue to reconcile independently against immutable published artifacts. Do not couple overlay changes to a source ticket unless the ticket explicitly names that external contract.

See [`docs/source-authority.md`](docs/source-authority.md) for the cutover audit and catastrophic-only unarchive boundary.

## Dependency and supply-chain updates

- Dependabot is configured security-updates-only in [`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml). Every entry sets `open-pull-requests-limit: 0`, which disables version updates for that ecosystem while security-update pull requests remain exempt. Version updates, auto-merge, and `docker`, `helm`, `docker-compose`, or `devcontainers` entries require a new recorded decision.
- Dependency pull requests are ticket-backed and are never self-merged. Security-only Dependabot pull requests may be reviewed directly without copying their diffs to a human branch; generated bot branch/commit names are the narrow naming exception below. Keep a ticket-prefixed PR title, ticket linkage, normal review/validation/production-impact evidence, and explicit publication intent. Only the user approves and merges; required CI is a floor, not an approval (DES-HOR-642-02).
- Security updates are grouped per configured directory. Leave `target-branch` unset, even for `master`: setting it makes the entry's options inapplicable to security updates, which always target the repository default branch. `make dependabot-check` guards this policy; post-merge observation still proves the actual PR shape. Do not add `group-by: dependency-name`, repository-level, or organization-level grouping that can converge components onto a version above the minimum patched version.
- GitHub Actions SHAs are refreshed manually in a ticket-backed change, never by a scheduled version-update pull request.
- Advisory disposition uses reachability evidence. Verify vendor-shrinkwrap-pinned packages against the installed and shipped on-disk version, not `npm audit`; dismiss untriggered advisories with the documented reason and record the evidence. Dismissed Moby daemon advisories and their re-entry triggers live in [`control-plane/docs/moby-test-dependency-risk.md`](control-plane/docs/moby-test-dependency-risk.md).
- Base-image and Dockerfile-frontend digests are governed by [`.github/inputs/remote-content.json`](.github/inputs/remote-content.json) and `.github/scripts/remote_content.py validate`, not by Dependabot.
- Coverage, exclusions, and the conventions for dependency pull requests are recorded in [`docs/dependencies.md`](docs/dependencies.md).

## Shared ticket and Git workflow

- Direct pushes to `master` are prohibited. Work on one `<TICKET>-<short-description>` branch.
- Branch names, commit messages, and pull request titles must include the Linear identifier, for example `HOR-123-short-description`, `HOR-123: describe change`, and `HOR-123 — Describe change`. Security-only Dependabot delivery may retain its generated bot branch/commit names; its PR title and delivery record must still link the ticket, and every review, CI, acceptance, and release gate still applies. See [`docs/dependencies.md`](docs/dependencies.md).
- Keep commits coherent and limited to the ticket. Do not mix unrelated component cleanup into an atomic change.
- Open a pull request when validation is complete; only the user may approve and merge it.
- Pull request bodies use `## Summary`, `## Validation`, `## Production impact`, and `## Ticket state`, with real Markdown line breaks and `None`/`N/A` where appropriate.
- After pushing, watch required CI to completion. A review is not addressable-complete and a ticket is not complete while required CI is failing.
- The required checks are `CI / required` and `E2E / required`. Pull requests run the deterministic affected-graph selection; the merge queue re-runs it strictly on the exact merge commit. See [`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md).
- A change to CI (`.github/**`, `testkit/**`, `release/**`, the root `Makefile`, `go.work`) must also pass full validation at the pull request's head before review is requested: add the `full-validation` label. Add the same label whenever the user or the ticket asks for full validation. The label triggers one run when it is added; remove and re-add it to validate a later head.
- Add the `e2e-real-machine` label to run the real-machine (F3) scenarios strictly on the pull request for AgentPool, LVM, storage, or bootstrap work, instead of first meeting them in the merge queue. The label is read when E2E runs, and adding it starts no run: add it before pushing, or push again after adding it. Removing it behaves the same way.
- Publication is never part of a pull request. It happens after merge, only through `release.yml`, only with founder approval in the protected `release` environment. Bump versions with `make bump TARGET=<target> VERSION=<x.y.z>` in the ticket that needs the release.
- The repository is the source of truth for non-secret infrastructure intent and architecture. Linear is the source of truth for ticket state, ownership, sequencing, and completion.

## Architecture decisions

Architectural decisions require explicit user approval before implementation, even when they seem consistent with existing guidance. This includes cross-service contracts, datastore/cache/transport choices, failure or isolation models, and patterns future tickets would inherit. Surface ambiguity instead of choosing unilaterally.

## Root validation and builds

Use root targets for atomic checks and component targets while working inside one owner:

```bash
make workspace-check  # go work sync freshness + every module's go list
make build            # production Go binaries, preserving component outputs
make test             # component tests + required Linux harness isolation + Forge E2E harness tests
make lint             # all Go modules, including Forge E2E
make codegen-check    # protobuf freshness
make charts-check     # Helm/static chart validation
make dependabot-check # security-only inventory + implicit default-branch guard
make release-check    # selector, release plan, version bump, AWS substrate, remote-content and cache contracts
make release-security-audit # authenticated GitHub environment, deploy-key, tag-ruleset, and workflow-permission audit
make bump TARGET=<target> VERSION=<x.y.z> # move every version field linked to one release target
make docker-build     # control-plane and inference-gateway images
make check            # complete local matrix above
make install-hooks    # shared monorepo pre-commit hook
```

Component-specific prerequisites and narrower commands live in each component's `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
