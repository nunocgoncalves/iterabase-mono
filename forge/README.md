# forge

> Canonical source: [`iterabase-mono/forge`](https://github.com/nunocgoncalves/iterabase-mono/tree/master/forge). The former standalone repository is historical and read-only.

`forge` is the installer for the Horizonshift / Iterabase platform. It bootstraps a production-ready single-node [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster on a VM or host over SSH, with dual-stack networking and prod-ready defaults.

> Per-customer, fully isolated, self-hosted. forge takes VMs/hosts (SSH) or a kubeconfig; it does **not** provision bare metal, Proxmox, or network appliances.

## Status

Walking skeleton (HOR-238). Implements single-node k3s bootstrap + the `forge` CLI. The platform Helm umbrella chart (HOR-239), GPU node readiness via the NVIDIA GPU Operator (HOR-240), Flux, and the overlay repo are follow-on tickets; the vLLM/SGLang backend is CRD-driven by the control-plane (HOR-306).

## Install

Pre-built binaries are published from the monorepo's protected release workflow on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nunocgoncalves/iterabase-mono/releases) page (linux/darwin × amd64/arm64), with checksums, an SBOM, provenance, compatibility, and validation evidence. Raw tags do not publish; see [`../docs/release.md`](../docs/release.md).

> Homebrew tap: deferred — `goreleaser` deprecated its `brews` section; the tap will return once the replacement stabilizes.

Build from source:

```sh
make build      # -> bin/forge
```

## Quickstart

```sh
forge init               # generate forge.yaml (interactive)
forge apply --dry-run    # preflight the target host and print the plan (read-only)
forge apply              # provision / reconcile the cluster
forge kubeconfig         # fetch (or refresh) the kubeconfig
forge status             # cluster health + drift
forge upgrade --to v1.34.10+k3s1 # upgrade to the current repository-reviewed k3s release
forge destroy            # customer-safe: uninstall k3s; preserve iterabase-data
forge destroy --purge-data-storage --reboot --yes # explicit empty-VG/PV decommission lifecycle
```

`forge` SSHes to the host as a sudoer user (key auth) and installs k3s with flags derived from `forge.yaml`. `spec.hosts[].sshHostKey` optionally pins one OpenSSH host public key; permanent automation must set it and fails on replacement. Forge verifies the repository-reviewed K3s executable and airgap image archive before placing either in a privileged path, then runs the pinned K3s service installer with downloads disabled. Helm and Flux are likewise installed only from reviewed archives after both archive and extracted-executable verification; Flux manifests are rejected unless every controller image is replaced by its reviewed digest before apply. Unsupported tool versions and changed bytes fail before execution or extraction, and retries cover transport only. These identities are recorded in `.github/inputs/remote-content.json`. The kubeconfig is fetched, rewritten to the host address, and stored at `~/.forge/<install>/kubeconfig.yaml`.

`apply` is **idempotent**: it reconciles from the live system — installs if absent, skips if in sync, refuses immutable changes (`cluster-cidr`/`service-cidr`/`dualStack` → `destroy` + `apply`), and routes version changes to `upgrade`.

When GPU support is enabled, the default GPU Operator chart archive is bound to its repository-reviewed SHA-256; a custom operator repository/version requires an explicit `gpu.operator.sha256`. `gpu.driver.version` and `gpu.driver.sha256` are both required, and Forge composes that exact driver tag-plus-digest together with repository-pinned operator, validator, toolkit, device-plugin, DCGM exporter, MIG manager, driver manager, and NFD identities. Forge verifies the downloaded chart archive before Helm inspects CRDs, templates, or applies it. Preflight then reports the NVIDIA PCI device and the complete driver-build surface: `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/Makefile`, `dkms`, `gcc`, and `make`. Before GPU Operator reconciliation, `apply` idempotently installs the matching `linux-headers-$(uname -r)`, `build-essential`, and `dkms` packages, verifies the exact surface, and refuses a stale running kernel whose matching headers are no longer available from the configured Ubuntu archives because the driver container must independently resolve that package. Apply then accepts readiness only from one coherent operator/node observation: the ClusterPolicy must expose `Ready=True` and `Error=False`, its configured driver must match any requested pin, and the single node must be Ready, schedulable, outside an active upgrade, and report that exact loaded driver. The GPU Operator's legacy `status.state=notReady` remains visible evidence but is not the sole authority because v26.3.3 writes it separately from conditions and can lose that status update to a resource-version conflict. Forge accepts that one documented contradiction only when every stronger current signal agrees; other missing or contradictory evidence keeps apply blocked, and `upgrade-failed` terminates it immediately. GPU Operator v26.3.3 embeds the NFD 0.18.3 subchart, but Forge pins its compatible runtime image to NFD v0.19.0 and sets the supported master `resyncPeriod` to 30 seconds. NFD v0.19.0 makes that interval drive a periodic full reconcile, so a missed fresh-NodeFeature event cannot defer the required NVIDIA node label until the operator readiness timeout. The embedded chart retains identical NodeFeature CRDs, supplies the default worker pod identity needed by v0.19.0, and leaves the topology updater (whose v0.19.0 image-only upgrade needs additional RBAC) disabled.

Before each Helm apply, forge reads the CRDs bundled in the exact pinned chart artifact, server-side applies them, and waits for them to become `Established`. This permits an existing release to enable an operator-backed dependency later (for example, enabling observability adds the Prometheus Operator CRDs) despite Helm's limitation that `crds/` are installed only during a release's initial install. Charts without bundled CRDs are unchanged. CRDs are intentionally retained on rollback/uninstall to protect custom resources and their data.

Every single-node config requires canonical `spec.dataStorage.devices`: a
non-empty lexically ordered immutable list of stable `/dev/disk/by-id/...`
blank whole-disk identities. Interactive init selects one or more devices;
repeated `--data-storage-device`, comma-separated
`FORGE_DATA_STORAGE_DEVICES`, and direct YAML express the same set. Duplicate,
conflicting, reordered persisted, missing, replaced, or changed sets fail
closed. Selecting that complete set is the sole first-write authorization;
there is no force, wipe, adopt, extend, replacement, or root fallback.

Before any disk mutation and again immediately before each `pvcreate`, Forge
performs bounded complete-set stable-identity, hardware/size, whole-device,
topology, system/root/boot/EFI/swap/K3s-backing, mount, holder,
LVM/RAID/crypt, partition/signature, and `/proc` raw-consumer checks. Missing
probes, read errors, descriptor races, ambiguity, or drift fail before K3s,
charts, workloads, or claims. Forge never scans every byte.

After a read-only preflight, Forge installs/verifies `lvm2` and XFS tooling,
converges the superseded pre-release `dm-snapshot` module/configuration to
absence, then uses a root-owned fsynced staged receipt to
bind exact planned-UUID PVs, a unique ownership tag, and the fixed thick VG name
`iterabase-data` before mutation. Forge creates the VG atomically with that tag
and LVM-generated UUID, then fsyncs the observed UUID before any handoff.
Reconcile, status, and purge accept only the receipt-matching tag/device/PV/VG
set. Purge records durable intent/completion around VG, each PV, and receipt
removal so interruption resumes exactly. Forge creates no platform LV,
filesystem, mount, or fstab entry; those belong to chart-owned OpenEBS LVM
LocalPV dynamic PVC lifecycle. Storage snapshots remain fully disabled; OPP-005
solely owns any future recovery mechanism.

K3s is installed with `local-storage` disabled. Forge installs the same-version
`cert-manager-substrate` and `lvm-storage-substrate` companions before the
platform, then waits for the pinned OpenEBS `1.10.0` CRDs, controller, node
plugin, CSI registration, exactly two managed non-default XFS/RWO classes, and
receipt-matching VG discovery. No local-path/default/root storage fallback is
reconciled.

Ordinary `forge destroy` uninstalls platform/K3s but preserves the receipt,
PVs, VG, LVs, and bytes. `--purge-data-storage` is separate explicit
decommissioning: after consumers and LVs are gone it revalidates the exact
receipt/device/PV/VG identities before removing only that VG and its PV
signatures. It refuses foreign, mounted, in-use, non-empty, missing, or drifted
state and is not secure erase. `--reboot` runs only after successful cleanup.
The non-interactive explicit form is
`forge destroy --purge-data-storage --reboot --yes`. See
[`../docs/architecture/v2-openebs-lvm-storage.md`](../docs/architecture/v2-openebs-lvm-storage.md).
